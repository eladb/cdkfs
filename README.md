## Summary
Define and maintain complex project configuration through code.

> JOIN THE [#TemplatesAreEvil] MOVEMENT!

projen synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`,
`tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, etc from a
well-typed definition written in `JavaScript`.

Check out this talk about projen.

As opposed to existing templating/scaffolding tools, projen is not a one-off
generator. Synthesized files should never be manually edited (in fact, projen
enforces that). To modify your project setup, users interact with rich
strongly-typed class and execute projen to update their project configuration
files.
