# Create a Django Application

This quick start will help you create a Django application using projen's Python project.

Before creating a new project, make sure you have the version of Python you want
to use set up in your terminal. Running `which python` in bash/zsh/other POSIX shells, or
`Get-Command python` in Powershell, should print the path to the Python version you
want to use.

To create a new Python project, use `projen new python`:

```shell
$ projen new python --name=my-project
```

This will synthesize a standard project directory structure with some sample
code.

```shell
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __main__.py
│   └── example.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_example.py
```

The default options will setup a Python environment using `venv`, and will
create a `requirements.txt` file for installing dependencies via `pip`.

The `projen new` command will also generate a `.projenrc.py` file which includes
the definition of your project with any options you specified in the command
line. Now that the project has been created, we want to edit this `.projenrc.py` file:

```python
from projen.python import PythonProject

project = PythonProject(
    author_email="Author email",
    author_name="Author name",
    module_name="your_python_project",
    name="project_name",
    version="0.1.0",
    # Add Django as a dependency
    deps=["Django"],  # Note that this always installs latest. Pin as needed with @<version>.
    # Add Django-related pytest packages as dev dependencies
    dev_deps=["pytest-django", "pytest-cov", "pytest-mock", "django-debug-toolbar", "django-queryinspect"],
)

project.synth()
```

Run the `projen` command again to re-synthesize your project with the new dependencies. That's it! You now have the libraries you need to get started with your Django application.
