# GitHub

By default, many projects are initialized with `GitHub` component to enabled GitHub as the default provider for CI/CD workflows. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions for more information.

The use of GitHub (and generating corresponding files in `.github`) can be disabled by specifying `github: false` in your project options.

### Workflows

TODO

See the `GitHub`, `GithubWorkflow`, and `Job` types in the [API reference](./api/API.md) for currently available APIs.
